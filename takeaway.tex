\section{High-level Takeaway}

This demo will demonstrate new data store performance and
administration functionality enabled by emerging consistency
prediction and monitoring. Given the amount of academic interest in
this topic and recent industrial adoption, we believe there is merit
in further study of applications that leverage these metrics. As a
proof-of-concept of several of the applications we envision, this
demonstration can serve as the impetus for a new wave of dynamic,
intelligent, and more easily operable distributed data
stores. Consistency metrics are coming; what else can we do with them?
