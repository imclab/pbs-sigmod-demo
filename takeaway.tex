\section{Takeaway}

This demo will demonstrate new data store performance and
administration functionality enabled by emerging consistency
prediction and monitoring. Given the amount of academic interest in
this topic and recent industrial adoption, we believe there is merit
in further study of these applications. As a proof-of-concept of
several of the applications we envision, this demonstration can serve
as the impetus for a new wave of dynamic, intelligent distributed data
stores.
