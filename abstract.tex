Recent work on Probabilistically Bounded Staleness (PBS)~\cite{pbs-vldb2012}
introduced an analytical and empirical framework for measuring the consistency
properties of an eventually consistent distributed data store. In this
demonstration we plan to exhibit how the consistency metrics predicted in PBS
can be used by application programmers and database administrators. 
We list three major application scenarios and present a system architecture that
can be used to support them. We also describe our experience in integrating PBS
into Cassandra, a popular key-value store and sketch our demonstration setup
that will allow SIGMOD attendees to experience the importance of consistency
metrics.
