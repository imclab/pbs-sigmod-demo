Recent work on Probabilistically Bounded Staleness
(PBS)~\cite{pbs-vldb2012} introduced an analytical and empirical
framework for measuring the consistency properties of an eventually
consistent distributed data store. This framework allows a wide range
of new database functionality such as advanced query tuning,
monitoring, and administration; our demonstration will exhibit how
both application programmers and database administrators can leverage
these features.  We describe three major application scenarios and
present a system architecture to support them. We also describe our
experience in integrating PBS into Cassandra, a popular NoSQL store
and sketch a demonstration that will allow SIGMOD attendees to
experience the importance and applicability of real-time consistency
metrics.
